##Overview

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Simulations

First, create the exponential distribution using 40 exponentials and a rate (or lambda) of 0.2. For this distribution, the mean and the standard deviation are 1/rate, or 5.
```{r}
exp_dist <- rexp(40, 0.2)
```

This gives us a random distribution

```{r}
hist(runif(1000))
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(runif(40)))
hist(mns)
```
